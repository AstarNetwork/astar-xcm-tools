# Astar XCM Tools

This is a tool for handling XCM calls from Astar Network and the relachain. In the long run, we want this tool to be the entry point for all XCM related operations on Astar Network.

At the moment, this tool only supports DMP asset transfers. We will increase the test cases as we go.

## Todo

- [x] Test DMP asset bridging (KSM from Kusama to Shiden)
- [ ] Test UMP asset bridging (KSM from Shiden to Kusama)
- [ ] Test HRMP asset bridging (transfer parachain asset to Shiden and vise versa)
- [ ] Test remote extrinsic call
- [ ] Develop channel manipulation scripts
